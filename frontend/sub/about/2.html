                How Kraft runs
            </div>
            <div class="font-bold mt-8">
                1. K3k
            </div>
            <div>
                Kraft is built on top of K3k, a Rancher project to run Kubernetes clusters inside Kubernetes. The more daring people
                may call this KinK :3 K3k runs pods on the host cluster with the API server and Kubelets and isolates the different
                clusters with namespaces, network policies, and more. For Kraft, I am running K3k in shared mode, which uses less
                resoures at the cost of isolation - it means your guest cluster will inherit access to ingressclasses and storageclasses
                which are present on the host.
            </div>

            <div class="font-bold mt-4">
                2. Longhorn
            </div>
            <div>
                Longhorn is a cloud native block storage solution for Kubernetes, is a Rancher project, also on the CNCF landscape as an
                incubating project. In the current configuration, Longhorn will create volume replicas on the host nodes, meaning any
                node could fail and the volume will still work fine. Also, I have both snapshot and backup schedules to Wasabi S3 so,
                in case I decimate the host cluster by accident, all your data can be recovered. At the end of the day, all of this means
                that your data is safe and is not at risk of being lost, particularly by hardware failures.
            </div>

            <div class="font-bold mt-4">
                3. Ingress Classes
            </div>
            <div>
                I won't tell you what's there at the time of writing, but by the time Kraft becomes ready, there will be both Traefik
                and Longhorn storage classes available for the guest clusters. You get to choose the ingressclass when you create
                your ingress resources.
            </div>

            <div class="font-bold mt-8">
                4. Hardware
            </div>
            <div>
                Again, not the present-day hardware. But eventually, Kraft will be running on 3 Talos VMs running on Proxmox. Talos has
                been chosen for security given there's no shell or anything really. Reducing the attack surface makes my life easier
                and should keep your clusters safer. Proxmox itself will be running on a single HP Proliant DL380 Gen8.
                Limitations with the setup - no UPS so powercuts will cause issues. I also have a single physical server so, if it fails
                or needs upgrading, Kraft will be down. And finally, it's running on a 200/50Mbps home connection so please don't
                expect too much out of it.
